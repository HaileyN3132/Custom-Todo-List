# *CUSTOMIZE TODO LIST*

Created by: **Hailey Ngo**

**Customized TODO List** is a dynamic and interactive task list that allows users to personalize their task layout using movable shapes. Instead of the traditional list format, users can drag and arrange tasks visually by placing them in multiple shapes such as circles, squares, ... that match their workflow or mood.
